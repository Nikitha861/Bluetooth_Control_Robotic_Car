Bluetooth controlled car with obstacle avoidance - IOT Project

__Project Overview__

This project involves building a Bluetooth-controlled robotic car that features obstacle detection and avoidance using various electronic components. The system is based on an Arduino Uno board, which serves as the central controller, interfacing with a Bluetooth module for wireless control, and sensors for navigation.

__Key Components__
Arduino Uno Board: The microcontroller that controls all the functionalities of the robotic car, processing inputs from sensors and executing movement commands.
L298N Motor Driver: Controls the speed and direction of the motors attached to the car's wheels, allowing it to move forward, backward, and turn.
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures the distance to obstacles ahead of the car, enabling obstacle detection and avoidance.
SG90 Servo Motor: Rotates the ultrasonic sensor to scan the area for obstacles.

__Motors with Wheels__: Provide the movement for the car, controlled by the L298N motor driver.
__Battery Pack__: Powers the Arduino and all connected components, ensuring the car has sufficient energy to operate.
__Jumper Wires__: Used to make all necessary electrical connections between the components.
__Switch__: Powers the entire system on or off.
__How It Works__
__Bluetooth Control__: The car is controlled via a Bluetooth module (HC-05/06), which receives commands from a paired smartphone or Bluetooth-enabled device. Commands include moving forward, backward, turning left or right, and stopping.

__Obstacle Detection and Avoidance__: The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor mounted on the SG90 Servo Motor scans the front of the car. If an obstacle is detected within a certain range, the car stops, reverses, and attempts to avoid the obstacle by turning.

__Implementation Steps__
__Hardware Setup__:

Connect the L298N motor driver to the motors with wheels and the Arduino Uno board.
Attach the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor to the servo motor and connect them to the Arduino.
Wire the Bluetooth module to the Arduinoâ€™s RX and TX pins.
Use jumper wires to make all the necessary connections between components.
Power the system using the battery pack and include a switch for easy power control.
__Software Setup__:

Upload the provided Arduino code to the Arduino Uno board.
Pair the Bluetooth module with a smartphone or Bluetooth device using a Bluetooth terminal app.
Send control commands to the car and observe its response.
Testing:

Test each command to ensure the car responds correctly.
Place obstacles in front of the car to verify the obstacle detection and avoidance feature.

__Conclusion__
This project is a hands-on way to learn about robotics, electronics, and programming. By integrating the listed components, you can create a functional robotic car that can be controlled remotely and intelligently navigates around obstacles.
